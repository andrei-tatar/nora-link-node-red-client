# @nora-link/node-red-client

Plugin for Node-RED to easily access local tunnels via [noralink.eu](https://noralink.eu).

## Getting an API key

1. Go to [https://noralink.eu/home](https://noralink.eu/home) and create an account
2. Navigate from the dropdown (or follow [link](https://noralink.eu/home/api-keys)) to the **Manage API keys** menu
3. Create a new key and copy it somewhere safe

## Accessing the tunnel

Just navigate to the chosen subdomain, (eg: [https://nodered.noralink.eu]()), login and enjoy!

## Available subdomains

Currently only a subset of subdomains are available to use with your own tunnels, from the following: *admin, api, app, control, dashboard, home, my, nodered, smarthome, test*.

If you want a new subdomain, add a request here: [Request a new subdomain thread](https://github.com/andrei-tatar/nora-link-client/issues/1).
